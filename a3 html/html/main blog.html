      <h4>Food preservation is both an art and a science. Our team uses evidence-based techniques including proper refrigeration, flash freezing, and safe reheating protocols to ensure every meal we serve is not only nutritious but also safe. We share the science behind our methods and how households can apply similar principles at home.</h4>
